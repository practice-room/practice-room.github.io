# The Practice Room

Every great musician would tell you that a great performance starts in the
practice room. It is also often said that *practice makes perfect*, but
perfection is often sought and rarely attained. In reality, we believe that
*practice makes consistent*.

**The Practice Room organization** is a workspace to apply that practice in
system administration and software development.

Organized by @komish.
